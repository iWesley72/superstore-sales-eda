# Superstore Sales EDA
<p>Main goal of this EDA was practice data visualization and frenquency distribution. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle, then I imported to Jupyter 
Notebook and cleaned it.</p>
<p>I believe it was pretty successful to describe the dataset and find it's key points, like profit distribution per sub category where we found products 
with profit loss. Another example is the months where the store has the biggest sales volume.</p>
<p>For those who want to compare this EDA to other Kaggle's EDA, the link for the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditisaxena20/superstore-sales-dataset.</p>
